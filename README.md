[![Deployment](../../actions/workflows/deployment.yml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/deployment.yml)
[![Code Quality](../../actions/workflows/code-quality.yml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/code-quality.yml)

Example project to get started with [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Get Started

You'll need [OpenJDK 11.x](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) and [Maven 3.6.x](https://maven.apache.org) installed.

> **Note**: Manual installation of [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org) is not required. The download and installation is done by the [Codehaus Cargo Maven 3 Plugin](https://codehaus-cargo.github.io/cargo/Maven+3+Plugin.html).

### Clone Repository

First of all, you need to clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/StefanZoneExamples/jakartaee.git
$ cd jakartaee
```

### Run Container

Then you're able to run the local [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org) container:

```bash
$ mvn clean verify cargo:run
```

It will listen on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) unless otherwise configured in `pom.xml`.

### Deploy

Execute the following command to deploy the **W**eb **AR**chive (WAR) to the running container. (Patience required)

> **Note**: By using [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), this command is executed automatically on each `Save`.

```bash
$ mvn package cargo:redeploy
```

### Code Quality

Enforce coding standards with [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org) and [PMD](https://pmd.github.io) by executing the following command.

```bash
$ mvn verify
```

### Cleanup

Cleanup (delete) `target` directory by executing the command:

```bash
$ mvn clean
```
